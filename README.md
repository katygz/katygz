👋 Hello, I'm Katy!

👀 I'm currently an MSBA student @ SMU Cox, located in Dallas, Texas. I am also a passionate data analyst, eager to explore the world of data and unravel its mysteries. My journey in the realm of analytics has equipped me with a diverse set of skills and proficiency in various data analysis tools(SQL/Python/R/Tableau).

🌱 I have a particular fascination with machine learning and am continuously expanding my knowledge in this area. With a thirst for knowledge and a hunger to solve complex problems, I find myself delving deeper into the world of data science.

🏄‍♀️ Outside the realm of data, I enjoy indulging in my hobbies. When I'm not busy crunching numbers, you can find me exploring the depths of the ocean through scuba diving, or experimenting with new and exciting recipes in the kitchen.

💞️ I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to contribute my analytical prowess. Let's connect and embark on exciting data-driven endeavors together! 🚀
